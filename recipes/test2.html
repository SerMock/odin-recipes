    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Our best ever spaghetti bolognese is super easy and a true Italian classic
      with a meaty, chilli sauce. This recipe comes courtesy of BBC Good Food

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti</li>
      <li>Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>Crushed Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Parmesan Rind</li>
      <li>Ground Beef</li>
      <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
      <li>Dried Basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat a large skillet over medium/high heat and add about 2 tbsp olive
        oil. When hot, add 1 chopped onion and cook for about 10 minutes, until
        they soften and start to caramelize. Then add 2 cloves minced garlic and
        stir for about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 pound ground beef and break it down into smaller pieces. You’ll
        need to cook it for about 10 more minutes or until it’s cooked through
        and doesn’t have any red or pink color inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 28 oz crushed tomatoes (I prefer fire roasted variety) and 2 tbsp
        tomato paste. Stir and bring to a light simmer, then reduce the heat to
        low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the seasoning (½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp black pepper, 1 tbsp dried basil,
        and ¼ tsp red pepper flakes) and stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a Parmesan rind, stir, and let the sauce simmer for about 20
        minutes, constantly stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        While it's cooking, we can start working on pasta. Boil a pot of water,
        season with water, and add 10 oz spaghetti. Cook according to the
        instructions until al-dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pasta is ready, drain the liquid, reserving 1 cup of starchy
        water. Then add the drained spaghetti to the sauce and stir together
        until evenly distributed. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a
        couple of tablespoons of reserved starchy water and mix again. Sprinkle
        some grated parmesan and chopped parsley before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
